# ChatGPT-Sentiment-Analysis
**## Project Description:** 
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to perform sentiment analysis on text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project involved collecting a large dataset of text data from various sources, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and using various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes to build the sentiment analysis model. I also used NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging to extract useful information from the text data and improve the model's accuracy.

The developed model can be used to analyze the sentiment of ChatGPT's responses to users' questions and feedback. This can provide valuable insights into the quality of ChatGPT's responses and user satisfaction levels. The project allowed me to showcase my skills in data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, machine learning algorithms, NLP techniques, and model evaluation.

**## Key Skills Demonstrated:**

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes)
- NLP techniques (tokenization, stemming, part-of-speech tagging)
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Report writing and presentation skills

**## Impact:**

- Improved understanding of user satisfaction levels and quality of responses in ChatGPT
- Enhanced user experience and engagement on the platform
- Potential for further applications in customer service, social media analysis, and product reviews analysis.
